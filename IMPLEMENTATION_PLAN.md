# Comprehensive Feature Build - Implementation Plan

## Status: Starting Implementation

This is a MASSIVE feature request with 8 phases. Given the scope, I'll implement systematically:

### Phase 0: CRITICAL UI FIX (In Progress)
- ✅ Fix button overlap in CoachDashboard.jsx
- Replace overlapping buttons with dropdown menu (three dots icon)
- Ensure proper spacing and mobile responsiveness

### Phase 1: Messaging & Notifications (Next)
- Create database schemas (conversations, messages, notifications tables)
- Build MessageCenter component
- Build MessageThread and MessageComposer components  
- Build NotificationBell component
- Add to navigation
- Implement realtime subscriptions
- Create email notification functions

### Phase 2-8: To be implemented sequentially
- Calendar integration (Cal.com)
- Reports & Analytics
- Lesson Management Enhancements
- Student Experience Enhancements
- Coach Productivity Tools
- Mobile Optimization
- Hitting Partner Enhancements

## Current Status
Working on button overlap fix, then will proceed with Phase 1 database schemas and core messaging components.
