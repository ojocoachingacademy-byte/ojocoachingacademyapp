## ✅ Current Approach

Given the scope, I'm implementing **incrementally**:

1. **✅ Complete UI fix first** (button overlap)
2. **⏳ Phase 1 systematically** (messaging & notifications)
3. **Test each phase** before moving to next
4. **Document progress** and provide status updates

## 🎯 Recommendation

This is a **multi-week project**. I recommend:
- Implement Phase 0 + Phase 1 first
- Test thoroughly
- Deploy Phase 1
- Then proceed with Phase 2
- Continue incrementally

**Alternative**: If you need all features quickly, consider breaking into separate projects or prioritizing which phases are most critical.

## 📝 Current Status

- ✅ Button overlap fix: **COMPLETED**
- ⏳ Starting Phase 1: Database schemas and messaging components
